# Aries Mediator Service

## TL;DR

This repository provides a simple process for a developer to run an Aries mediator agent. You should be able to bring the stack on-line by copying `.env.stample` to `.env` and running `docker-compose up`. For more information, keep reading.

## Build & Run 

This is setup to be run as is with a simple `docker-compose up`. When run it will fire up the following containers:

### ngrok

You need to accept inbound connections. Most of us are behind firewalls or have impermanent IP addresses. Ngrok is used as a proxy to work around this. It will provide the URL that will act as a front door for your Wallet.

If you have a paid account you can provide your access token as one of the parameters. If not, leave it blank and it'll assume your on the free plan.

ProTip ü§ì 

- Free plans can only keep a connection open for 60 minutes. After this, you will need to restart the stack. If this gets annoying, use a paid plan for a long lived tunnel :)
- Every time your restart the stack (all the containers) the URL will change. You may be able to work around this with different paid plans.

### Caddy

Your wallet will need to open two connections to the mediator. The first will be a standard **https** port that will be used to establish a connection then, as needed after this. The second will be a **wss** connection over which messages will be sent. You can setup two independent URLs for this purpose but its more clear if to just use one. Caddy will redirect **https** and **wss** traffic to the correct port of the mediator.

### Mediator Demo Controller

The controller is what ACA-py uses to handle web hooks. This custom **nodejs** app, written in TypeScript, uses [Feathers JS](https://feathersjs.com) to provide RESTFull endpoints to ACA-py. It was contributed to the project by [Indicio](https://indicio.tech) üôè.

### Mediator

A mediator is just a special type of agent. In this case, the mediator is ACA-py, with a few special config params, into make it run as a mediator rather than a traditional agent.

About 1/2 of the params for ACA-py are provided in `start.sh`, others are passed via a configuration file [mediator-auto-accept.yml](./acapy/configs/mediator.yml). Move them around as you see fit. Ones that are likely to change are better kept as environment variables.

### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is well known RDBMS. It is used by the mediator persist wallet information. Without it, the wallet would be reset every time the stack is restarted. The first time the mediator container runs it will create a database for its wallet and initialize the wallet state.

### Run It !

1. Start by cloning this repo:

```console
git clone git@github.com:fullboar/aries-mediator-service.git
```

2. Copy the file `env.sample` to `.env` in the root of the project. The default values are fine, edit as you see fit. This file will be used by `docker-compose` to add or override any environment variables.

```console
cp env.sample .env
```

ProTip ü§ì

You can generate strong tokens for production with `OpenSSL`:

```console
openssl rand 32 -hex
```

3. Bring up the stack. When you first run this command it will build the mediator container so it may take a few moments. Subsequent restarts will be much faster.

```console
docker-compose up
```

When the stack is on-line you'll see a big white QR code scroll up your screen, just above that is your invitation URL. I'll look something like this:

```console
mediator_1             | https://ed49-70-67-240-52.ngrok.io?c_i=eyJAdHlwZSI6ICJkaWQ6c292OkJ6Q2JzTlloTXJqSGlxWkRUVUFTSGc7c3BlYy9jb25uZWN0aW9ucy8xLjAvaW52aXRhdGlvbiIsICJAaWQiOiAiZmYwMjkzNmYtNzYzZC00N2JjLWE2ZmYtMmZjZmI2NmVjNTVmIiwgImxhYmVsIjogIk1lZGlhdG9yIiwgInJlY2lwaWVudEtleXMiOiBbIkFyVzd1NkgxQjRHTGdyRXpmUExQZERNUXlnaEhXZEJTb0d5amRCY0UzS0pEIl0sICJzZXJ2aWNlRW5kcG9pbnQiOiAiaHR0cHM6Ly9lZDQ5LTcwLTY3LTI0MC01Mi5uZ3Jvay5pbyJ9
```

The `c_i` parameter is your reusable invitation encoded as base64. Feel free to decode it and see what's inside.

Decoded `c_i`:

```json
{"@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/invitation", "@id": "ff02936f-763d-47bc-a6ff-2fcfb66ec55f", "label": "Mediator", "recipientKeys": ["ArW7u6H1B4GLgrEzfPLPdDMQyghHWdBSoGyjdBcE3KJD"], "serviceEndpoint": "https://ed49-70-67-240-52.ngrok.io"}
```

### Aries Bifold Wallet Integration

You can easily use your newly minted mediator with the Aries Bifold wallet. Just take the full invitation URL above and provide it to Bifold through the `MEDIATOR_URL` parameter. This can be from an environment variable, or, a more reliable way is to create a `.env` file in the root of the project folder with the parameter `MEDIATOR_URL` in it.

```console
MEDIATOR_URL=https://ed49-70-67-240-52.ngrok.io?c_i=eyJAdHlwZSI6ICJkaWQ6c292OkJ6Q2JzTlloTXJqSGlxWkRUVUFTSGc7c3BlYy9jb25uZWN0aW9ucy8xLjAvaW52aXRhdGlvbiIsICJAaWQiOiAiZmYwMjkzNmYtNzYzZC00N2JjLWE2ZmYtMmZjZmI2NmVjNTVmIiwgImxhYmVsIjogIk1lZGlhdG9yIiwgInJlY2lwaWVudEtleXMiOiBbIkFyVzd1NkgxQjRHTGdyRXpmUExQZERNUXlnaEhXZEJTb0d5amRCY0UzS0pEIl0sICJzZXJ2aWNlRW5kcG9pbnQiOiAiaHR0cHM6Ly9lZDQ5LTcwLTY3LTI0MC01Mi5uZ3Jvay5pbyJ9
