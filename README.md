# Mediator


## Local Build Process

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.base --no-cache -t indicio-tech/aries-mediator-base .
```

```
docker build --no-cache --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=indicio-tech/aries-mediator-base --build-arg IMAGE_VER_BASE=latest -t indicio-tech/aries-mediator .
```

You can run the docker container like so.

```
sh
export IMAGE_VER=latest
export IMAGE_NAME_FQ=indicio-tech/aries-mediator

docker run -it \
    -e DEPLOYMENT_ENV=TEST \
    -e AGENT_NAME=mediator-test \
    -e WALLET_NAME=test-1 \
    -e HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://example.com:3007 \
    -e WS_ENDPOINT=ws://example.com:3008 \
    -e HTTP_PORT=3007 \
    -e WS_PORT=3008 \
    -e RDBMS_URL=localhost:5432 \
    -e RDBMS_AUTH='{"account":"postgres","password":"setectastronomy","admin_account":"postgres","admin_password":"setectastronomy"}' \
    \
    -p 3007:3007 \
    -p 3008:3008 \
    \
    $IMAGE_NAME_FQ:$IMAGE_VER
```

You can also run the docker container in a development sandbox by running

```
docker-compose up
```

## Configuration

When running the Docker container, the following environment variables must be specified (see below for example values):

- `DEPLOYMENT_ENV`: May be one of *DEV*, *TEST*, or *PROD*. Currently only *TEST* is implemented.
- `HTTP_PORT`: The port that the mediator should listen on for HTTP connections.
- `WS_PORT`: The port that the mediator should listen on for WebSocket connections.
- `HTTP_ENDPOINT`: The URI that the mediator should advertise for client connections over HTTP; this may use a different port than specified for `HTTP_PORT` in the case that a proxy or load balancer is used in front of the mediator instance.
- `WS_ENDPOINT`: The URI that the mediator should advertise for client connections over HTTP; this may use a different port than specified for `WS_PORT` in the case that a proxy or load balancer is used in front of the mediator instance.
- `AGENT_NAME`: The advertised name of the mediator.
- `WALLET_NAME`: Name for the mediator's wallet. All wallets will use the same PostgreSQL instance but different tables.
- `RDBMS_URL`: Host and port for the PostgreSQL instance where the wallet data will be stored.
- `RDBMS_AUTH`: JSON string specifying the credentials to use when connecting to the database. As demonstrated below, two sets of credentials are specified; one for normal data access and storage, and an "admin" credential that is used to initialize a new wallet. Currently the "admin" credential is always required by ACA-Py even when the wallet already exists, but there is work in progress to remedy this in the upstream codebase.

Optional:

- GENESIS_URL (default: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis)

In addition, be sure to expose the ports above on the Docker host.

Here's an example showing how to run the container directly from the CLI in interactive mode:

```sh
export IMAGE_VER=0.0.1
export IMAGE_NAME_FQ=707906211298.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/indicio-tech/aries-mediator

docker run -it \
    -e DEPLOYMENT_ENV=TEST \
    -e AGENT_NAME=mediator-test \
    -e WALLET_NAME=test-1 \
    -e HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://example.com:8000 \
    -e WS_ENDPOINT=ws://example.com:8080 \
    -e HTTP_PORT=8000 \
    -e WS_PORT=8080 \
    -e RDBMS_URL=localhost:5432 \
    -e RDBMS_AUTH='{"account":"postgres","password":"setectastronomy","admin_account":"postgres","admin_password":"setectastronomy"}' \
    \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    \
    $IMAGE_NAME_FQ:$IMAGE_VER
```

## Boostrapping

The first time a container runs with a new wallet, it will create a database in PostgreSQL for that wallet and initialize the wallet state. ACA-Py will output an invitiation that can be retrieved from the logs as needed:

https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-2#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/$252Fecs$252Fmediator-test

In order to create the database, an admin account account and password must be provided in `RDBMS_AUTH`. Thereafter, this admin account should not be necessary and should be removed from the task definition.

For the production environment, additional controls will be put in place to secure the wallet and postgres credentials. (TBD)

## Building

The ECR domain that we use for our test environment is:

`707906211298.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`

1. Ensure Docker and the AWS CLI are installed. See also: [Getting Started with Amazon ECR](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html). You can use
a separate profile for the indicio-tech account by creating a directory for the same and
then setting the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variables (see
also: [Configuration and Credential File Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)):

    ```sh
    mkdir .aws
    export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=$(pwd)/.aws/config
    export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=$(pwd)/.aws/credentials
    aws configure
    ```

2. Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry:

    ```sh
    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 707906211298.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
    ```

3. (Optional) Build and push the base image. This must be done occasionally to update system packages (if nothing else, doing so ensures the system has the latest security patches). Note that you will need to set the IMAGE_VER_BASE environment variable:

    ```sh
    cd mediator
    IMAGE_VER_BASE=0.1.0 DEPLOYMENT_ENV=TEST ./deploy build mediator --base && IMAGE_VER_BASE=0.1.0 DEPLOYMENT_ENV=TEST ./deploy push mediator --base
    ```

   By default, `deploy` tags the image with the test environment ECR domain, but this can be overridden by setting the `ECR_DOMAIN` environment variable.

3. Build the image. Note that you will need to set the IMAGE_VER and IMAGE_VER_BASE environment variables:

    ```sh
    cd mediator
    IMAGE_VER_BASE=0.1.0 IMAGE_VER=0.3.0 DEPLOYMENT_ENV=TEST ./deploy build mediator
    ```

   By default, `deploy` tags the image with the test environment ECR domain, but this can be overridden by setting the `ECR_DOMAIN` environment variable.

4. Test the image.

5. Push the image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR):

    ```sh
    IMAGE_VER_BASE=0.1.0 IMAGE_VER=0.1.0 DEPLOYMENT_ENV=TEST ./deploy push mediator
    ```

6. The image can now be deployed to AWS Elastic Container Services (ECS).

## Deploying

The Indicio test environment consists of an AWS ECS cluster and task definitions, a VPC, security groups, and an RDS postgres instance.

Resources are all located in the us-east-2 (Ohio) region:

* ECS Cluser: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/clusters/mediator-test/services
* Task Definition: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/taskDefinitions/mediator-test/status/ACTIVE
* RDS Instance: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-2#database:id=pg-mediator-test;is-cluster=false
* VPC: `vpc-0adb1b91d540e6bdc`
* Security Groups:
    * PostgreSQL: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-2#SecurityGroup:groupId=sg-09cca4df418dfa271
    * Mediator: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-2#SecurityGroup:groupId=sg-0505c4b8b008da4db
* Logs: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-2#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/$252Fecs$252Fmediator-test

To configure the mediator:

1. Go to the `Task Definitions` page in the Amazon ECS console for the us-east2 (Ohio) region.
2. Select the task definition to edit (e.g., `mediator-test`).
3. Under `Container Definitions` click on the container name.
4. Under `Environment` edit the environment variables as needed.

To launch a new task:

1. Go to the `mediator-test` cluster page in the Amazon ECS console for the us-east-2 (Ohio) region.
2. Select the `Tasks` tab and click `Run new Task`.
3. Choose the FARGATE launch type.
4. Choose `vpc-0adb1b91d540e6bdc` as the cluster VPC.
5. Choose one or both of the subnets for the cluster VPC.
6. Edit the security group and choose `sg-0505c4b8b008da4db`.
7. Chose `ENABLED` for the public IP auto-assignment. Fargate does not currently support elastic IPs directly; if necessary, an Application Load Balancer can be used to front the mediator instance and provide a stable IP address.
8. If accessing the instance directly, add/update the DNS record for the instance in Route53.
9. Retrieve the invitiation URL from CloudWatch Logs as needed.

## Debugging

When debugging an issue, you may wish to modify the app's logging level by editing `mediator/app/logging.ini`.
